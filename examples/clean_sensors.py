"""
This example demonstrates how to clean the sensors of the Nicla Sense Env after unboxing / assembly.

The cleaning mode performs a thermal cleaning cycle of the MOx element. It can eliminate some light pollution 
residues from production and packaging and improves the stabilization processes in the sensor. 
The function heats up the sensor to allow thermal desorption and catalytic combustion of the residues. 
The cleaning cycle can be executed only once in the sensor lifetime and shall be started after product assembly. 
Please ensure cleaning was completed before power-off/reset and do not interrupt while cleaning.
The cleaning procedure takes 1 minute (blocking).
